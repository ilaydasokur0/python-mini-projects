# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

Hello! I am a **Mathematical Engineering student** currently improving my programming skills through hands-on Python projects.

This repository contains a collection of **mini projects developed during my Python learning journey**.  
Each project is designed to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts and practical software development.

My objective is to build a strong foundation in Python by working on real-world inspired applications and continuously improving my coding practices.

## 📌 Project 1: Library Management System

A command-line based library management system developed using Python.

This application provides the following features:

- User registration and authentication  
- Borrowing up to three books at a time  
- Returning borrowed books  
- Donating new books to the library  
- Displaying available and borrowed books  
- Persistent data storage using JSON  

All user and book information is saved locally and automatically loaded when the program starts.

## 🚀 What I Learned from This Project

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python classes  
- Designing and managing data models (`User`, `Book`)  
- File handling and persistent storage with JSON  
- Date and time operations using the `datetime` module  
- Input validation and reusable helper functions  
- Structuring programs using modular functions  
- Improving code readability and maintainability  
- Version control using Git and GitHub  

This project helped me understand how to design and implement a complete, functional application from scratch.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/ilaydasokur0/python-mini-projects.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   cd python-mini-projects/library_system

3. Run the application:

   python library.py

The application runs in the terminal and saves data locally in a JSON file.

More projects will be added as I continue developing my skills in Python.
